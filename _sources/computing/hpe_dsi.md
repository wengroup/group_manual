# HPE DSI

This page describes the basics of using the HPE Data Science Institute clusters at UH.

## Getting an account

If you have never used HPE DSI clusters, first request an account at https://uh.edu/rcdc/getting-started/request-account.php. The below information may be needed:

- Principal Investigator (PI): Mingjian Wen
- PI Email address: mjwen@uh.edu
- Grant information: N/A
- Please select the Resource (Cluster): `Carya` or `Sabine` # Check with Mingjian on which cluster to use
- Please select your login shell: Bash

You will receive an email shortly after submitting your request, which contains the login information such as your `username` (called `Login name` in the email).

```{tip}
For all the below sections, replace `<username>` by your username. And replace `<clustername>` by either `carya` or `sabine` depending on which cluster you are using.
```

## Logging into the system

You need to use `ssh` to log into the cluster.
In any terminal on Linux or Mac ([Linux subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) can be installed on Windows), type

```shell
ssh <username>@<clustername>.rcdc.uh.edu
```

Replace `<username>` by yours and replace `<clustername>` by the corresponding cluster name. press `Enter` and then provide your CougarNet credentials to login.

```{tip}
The clusters can be accessed via the `UHSecure` not the `UHGuest` network. If you cannot log in and see error message like `ssh: connect to host carya.rcdc.uh.edu port 22: Operation timed out`, check your Wi-Fi connection.

If you are off campus, use UH [VPN](https://uh.edu/infotech/services/computing/networks/vpn/) to get access.
```

## Transferring data

Transfer a file from your laptop to the cluster:

```shell
scp </local/path/my_file.txt> <username>@<clustername>.rcdc.uh.edu:</remote/path/>
```

Replace `</local/path/my_file.txt>` by the path to your file on your laptop,
and `</remote/path/>` by the path to a directory on Carya where you want to place
your file.

Transfer a file from Carya to your laptop:

```shell
scp <username>@<cluster>.rcdc.uh.edu:/remote/path/my_file.txt /local/path
```

Again, replace `</local/path>` by the path to a directory on your laptop where you want to place
your file, and `</remote/path/my_file.txt>` by the path to your file on Carya.

Alternatively, if you prefer a graphical user interface or want to transfer a large amount of data, `globus` is a good option. See [HPE DSI User Guide](https://uh.edu/rcdc/support-services/user-guide/getting-started-clusters) for instructions. [TODO: add instructions here].

## Submitting jobs

- Do not submit jobs from your home directory `/home/<username>`, which is not configured for I/O and has a limited storage space of 10GB.
- Do not submit jobs on the login node; it can affect other users.

Instead, submit jobs to the compute node from the project directory and using [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com) script.

First, create a directory with your `username`:

```
$ cd /project/wen
$ mkdir <username>      # change <username> to yours
$ chmod g-w <username>  # remove write access for others
```

All your jobs should be submitted in the `project/wen/<username>` directory and its subdirectories.

Next, let's submit a job. Suppose you want to run a python script `example.py` placed in `project/wen/<username>`. A Slurm script for it can be:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l

#SBATCH --job-name=my_1st_job
#SBATCH --account=wen           # account of our group
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00         # run for a max of 10 mins
#SBATCH --nodes=1               # run on 1 node

python example.py
```

Copy the above content into a file named, e.g., `submit.sh`, and place it in the same directory as `example.py`. Then you can submit the job using `sbatch`:

```
$ sbatch submit.sh
```

## Using GPU

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l

#SBATCH --job-name=my_1st_job
#SBATCH --account=wen
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --mem=10GB  # don't forget this; otherwise, it can throw out-of-memory error
#SBATCH --gpus=1    # run on 1 gpu

python example.py
```

## Checking balance

To check the group allocations and accounts, use

```
$ sbalance
```

## Authentication via ssh (optional)

You need to enter the CougarNet password every time you log in or use `scp`. You can
avoid this by using ssh authentication.

1. Generate SSH keys if you have not done so. See [SSH](label:ssh) for instructions.

2. Copy you public key (replace `<username>` by yours):

   ```shell
   $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <username>@<clustername>.rcdc.uh.edu "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
   ```

   This copies your public key in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to the cluster, and appends it to
   `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the cluster. You will be asked for your password.

After doing this, you can log in without entering your CougarNet password.
If you have a passphrase for your private key, you will be asked for it.
But you can avoid this by adding your private key to the ssh-agent. See
[SSH](label:ssh) for instructions.
