# Onboarding Guide

This onboarding guide is meant to serve as the first stop for new students and
postdocs joining the group.

## Computing devices

- Select computing devices for your research, including a Macbook Pro (the 14" model
  is a great choice), keyboard and trackpad, a monitor (e.g., `DELL P2723QE`),
  a SSD Drive (e.g., `WD 4TB My Passport for Mac`) and other accessories.
  Try using official Apple and Dell websites with which UH has a contract. Amazon is a good alternative.
- Email Mingjian a list of your chosen devices with links to the product pages for approval.
- Contact `Manjunatha Shenoy` (director of engineering computing) to obtain a quote,
  and then ask `Nicolette Solano` (department administrative assistant) to help with purchase.
  Only send Apple and Dell products to Shenoy for quote; other products can be purchased directly
  by Nicolette.
- Configure your laptop for computational research, following [Setting up Your Laptop](label:laptop).

## Meetings

- Schedule with Mingjian a first meeting to discuss and plan your research projects.
- After the meeting, make a Pull Request [here](https://github.com/wengroup/group_website)
  to add your headshot and a brief intro of your research to be put on the group website.
- Schedule with Mingjian regular meetings to discuss your research progress and
  get feedback.

## Misc

- We use Teams for swift research discussion, seeking help, sharing awesome papers
  and such. Ask an existing group member to invite you to the group Teams workspace.
- Contact `Nicolette Solano` to request for a key to the group office.
- After obtaining your Cougar Card, check with `David Dawlearn` and ask for access to the building and other offices.

## Coding

- We use Unix-like operating systems and the command line interface (CLI) for most of our work.
  Get comfortable with the CLI by doing the Software Carpentry [Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
  tutorials and referring to the [Command Line Tools](label:cli) page.
- We mostly program in Python and use other languages (e.g., C++ and Rust) when necessary.
  Get yourself familiar with Python by waking through the [Programming with
  Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) tutorials.
  Another great resource is the tutorials by [The Python Guru](https://thepythonguru.com).
- Setting up Conda environments for your projects is a good practice. See [Conda Environment](label:conda).
