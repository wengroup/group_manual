# Using LaTeX

For technical writing, we recommend [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), a document typesetting system.

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started using latex is to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an online LaTeX editor. It is free to use and has a rich set of features.
If you haven't used Overleaf before, you can start with the [Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes tutorial](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes).

Alternatively, you can install a LaTeX distribution on your computer. See [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) for macOS.

## Tips

LaTex is a powerful typesetting system, and there are a lot of customizations you can do with it. Here are some tips that we find useful.

1. Write each sentence in a separate line. This makes it easier to navigate long paragraphs using text editors like `vim`, also makes it easier to track changes in `git`.

2. Label your figures, equations, tables, sections, etc. consistently. For example,

   ```latex
   \begin{figure}
       \centering
       \includegraphics{figures/diamond_crystals.pdf}
       \caption{Crystal structure of cubic diamond.}
       \label{fig:diamond}
    \end{figure}
   ```

   It is a good practice to use the prefix `fig:` for figures, `tab:` for tables, `eq:` for equations, `sec:` for sections, etc. This makes it easier to refer to them later in the text.

3. Instead of using `\ref` to refer to figures, equations, tables, sections etc., define your onw macros to customize the reference. Put the below in the preamble of your document.

   ```latex
   \newcommand*{\fref}[1]{Fig.~\ref{#1}}
   \newcommand*{\tref}[1]{Table~\ref{#1}}
   \newcommand*{\eref}[1]{Eq.~\eqref{#1}}
   \newcommand*{\sref}[1]{Section~\ref{#1}}
   \newcommand*{\aref}[1]{Appendix~\ref{#1}}
   ```

   This does nothing but add a prefix to the reference. For example, `\ref{fig:diamond}` will only give `1`. With the above macros, you can use `\fref{fig:diamond}` to get `Fig. 1`.

4. Add a slash `\ ` after a period to indicate that it is not the end of a sentence. For example, you should write `The U.S.\ is a country.`, instead of `The U.S. is a country.`. The period after `U.S.` is not the end of the sentence, so we add a slash `\ ` after it. This will make the spacing between `U.S.` and `is` correct. Similarly, you should use `e.g.\ ` instead of `e.g. ` in the middle of a sentence.

5. Use `\mathrm{}` for text in math mode. For example, the Boltzmann constant should be written as `$k_\mathrm{B}$`, which gives $k_\mathrm{B}$, instead of `$k_B$`, which gives $k_B$. By default, all text in math mode is italicized. Here `B` stands for the text Boltzmann, and we use `\mathrm{}` to make it upright.
